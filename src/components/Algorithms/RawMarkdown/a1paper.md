## Problem Statement

There's an infinite number of paper types: $A_1$, $A_2$, $A_3$, and so on. An $A_2$ paper has dimensions $2^{-3/4} \times 2^{-5/4}$, $A_3$ has dimensions $2^{-5/4} \times 2^{-7/4}$, and so on. Each paper has a dimension ratio of $1 : \sqrt{2}$. In terms of area, every paper $A_i$ has twice the area of $A_{i+1}$.

Two $A_2$ papers can be joined into an $A_1$ paper by connecting them with tape of length $2^{-3/4}$ (connecting by the long side). We can also use 4 pieces of tape to join four $A_3$ papers into one $A_1$ paper.

Given $n_2, n_3, n_4, \ldots, n_N$ (the number of $A_2$, $A_3$, $A_4$, $\ldots$, $A_N$ papers you have respectively), is it possible to create an $A_1$ paper by taping them together? If so, **how much tape is needed**?
