## Problem Statement

The classic 2-dimensional 2048 consists of $x$ and $y$ axes, and the 3-dimensional version adds an additional $z$ axis that turns the grid into a cube. But what about a 4-dimensional game? This is impossible to visualize, but it would consist of four $4 \times 4 \times 4$ cubes. What about a 5th, 6th, or 7th dimension? What if we were given an $n$-dimensional board, with $4^n$ tiles?

With 2 dimensions, there are 4 directions: up, down, left, right. With 3 dimensions, there are 6 commands: the first four, plus an in/out direction.

**Given an $n$-dimensional board and a direction, how could we compute the outcome of shifting the board in that direction?**
